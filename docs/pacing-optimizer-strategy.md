# Pacing Optimizer Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for implementing a reverse-optimization pacing system that works backward from target goals to prescribe segment-specific paces. The system presents results through familiar "grade equivalent" factors that runners can intuitively understand.

## Core Concept

Instead of simply calculating arrival times based on distance and pace (t=d/v), we implement a **reverse-optimization pacing system** that:

1. Starts with runner's target goals (finish time, average pace, etc.)
2. Works backward to determine required effort levels for each segment
3. Optimizes pace distribution considering terrain, environment, and physiology
4. Presents recommendations as actionable pace guidance with intuitive explanations

## System Architecture

### 1. Input Layer

#### Primary Target Options
- **Target finish time**: Specific goal time for race completion
- **Target average pace**: Grade-adjusted overall pace goal
- **Specific waypoint arrival times**: Time targets for key checkpoints
- **Negative split strategy**: Faster second half execution (e.g., 52%/48% split)
- **Even effort strategy**: Consistent physiological load throughout race

#### Course Data Requirements
- Elevation profile with smoothed grade calculations
- Distance markers and waypoint locations
- Environmental factors (temperature, altitude, time of day progression)
- Surface type and terrain difficulty ratings
- Historical weather patterns for race date/time

### 2. Optimization Engine

#### Multi-Factor Pace Model
- **Base fitness pace**: Runner's flat, optimal conditions pace capability
- **Grade adjustment curves**: Existing 4th-degree polynomial for terrain impact
- **Environmental factors**: Heat, altitude, air quality, wind effects
- **Fatigue modeling**: Performance degradation over distance and time
- **Surface/terrain modifiers**: Trail vs road, technical sections, aid station impacts

#### Optimization Algorithms
- **Forward simulation**: Calculate projected finish time from given pace strategy
- **Reverse optimization**: Solve for required segment paces to achieve target time
- **Constraint satisfaction**: Balance physiological limits with time goals
- **Monte Carlo variations**: Account for uncertainty and provide confidence intervals

### 3. Constraint Management

#### Physiological Limits
- Maximum sustainable pace for given segment duration
- Heart rate zone boundaries and lactate threshold considerations
- Glycogen depletion modeling and fueling requirements
- Heat stress and cooling capacity limits
- Altitude acclimatization factors

#### Practical Constraints
- Minimum/maximum reasonable pace ranges for safety
- Technical terrain speed limitations
- Mandatory aid station time requirements
- Weather condition impacts (darkness, precipitation, temperature extremes)
- Course cutoff time requirements

### 4. Optimization Strategies

#### Strategy A: Time-Target Optimization
1. Begin with specific target finish time
2. Allocate time budget across course segments based on difficulty analysis
3. Calculate required "effort level" for each segment to stay on schedule
4. Convert effort levels to specific pace recommendations
5. Express rationale as "equivalent grade factors" for intuitive understanding

#### Strategy B: Effort-Based Optimization
1. Define target effort distribution (e.g., "80% effort first half, 85% second half")
2. Calculate sustainable pace for each effort level per terrain segment
3. Project cumulative time and iterate adjustments as needed
4. Present as pace recommendations with clear effort explanations

#### Strategy C: Negative Split Optimization
1. Target faster second half with specified split ratio
2. Model energy expenditure, glycogen depletion, and recovery patterns
3. Calculate optimal pacing curve that enables strong finish
4. Build in early conservatism buffer for energy banking

#### Strategy D: Even Effort Optimization
1. Maintain consistent physiological stress throughout race
2. Adjust pace continuously based on terrain and environmental factors
3. Optimize for sustainable effort rather than time splits
4. Minimize risk of performance degradation from over-exertion

### 5. User Interface Strategy

#### Pacing Prescription Display Format
```
Segment: Miles 5-8 (Damascus Approach)
Target Pace: 8:15/mile
Effort Breakdown:
  - Base fitness pace: 7:30/mile
  - Grade factor: +0:35/mile (equivalent to 2.1% uphill)
  - Heat factor: +0:05/mile (morning temperature rise)
  - Fatigue factor: +0:05/mile (cumulative effort load)
Feels Like: "Comfortable uphill effort, should feel sustainable"
Heart Rate Target: 145-155 bpm (Zone 2-3)
```

#### Alternative Visualization Options
- **Effort intensity bars**: Visual representation of relative difficulty by segment
- **Heart rate zone mapping**: Expected HR ranges for each segment
- **Time banking concepts**: Visual display of gaining/losing time vs target schedule
- **Energy expenditure tracking**: Glycogen usage and fueling recommendations

### 6. Advanced Features

#### Dynamic Replanning Capabilities
- **Real-time pace adjustment**: Update plan based on actual vs predicted progress
- **Environmental condition updates**: Adjust for changing weather, temperature
- **Fatigue assessment integration**: Modify plan based on perceived effort feedback
- **Course condition updates**: Adapt to trail conditions, crowding, aid station delays

#### Multiple Strategy Variants
- **Conservative plan**: Build in 5-10% time buffer for contingencies
- **Aggressive plan**: Minimal safety buffer, assumes near-perfect execution
- **Adaptive plan**: Multiple bail-out points with revised target scenarios

#### Scenario Planning Tools
- **What-if analysis**: "What if I'm 10 minutes behind at mile 15?"
- **Environmental scenarios**: "What if weather turns hot/cold/windy?"
- **Performance scenarios**: "What if I feel stronger/weaker than planned?"
- **Equipment scenarios**: "What if I have gear issues or need extended aid station time?"

### 7. Validation & Feedback Loop

#### Model Calibration Process
- **Post-race analysis**: Compare predicted vs actual performance outcomes
- **Factor adjustment**: Refine grade, fatigue, and environmental multipliers
- **User feedback integration**: Incorporate perceived effort vs predicted effort data
- **Population data analysis**: Improve model accuracy using aggregate race results

#### Confidence and Risk Assessment
- **Uncertainty quantification**: Show prediction ranges (e.g., "Finish time: 4:15-4:25, 80% confidence")
- **Risk assessment metrics**: "This plan has 15% probability of significant performance degradation"
- **Contingency planning**: Built-in alternative strategies for common failure modes

## Key Innovation Points
