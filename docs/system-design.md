# Shpacer System Design Document

## Overview

Shpacer is a self-hosted web application designed for race course planning and analysis. It provides tools for uploading GPS track files, visualizing course data, managing waypoints, and analyzing race metrics. The system is built using modern web technologies with a focus on user experience, data accuracy, and extensibility.

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Nuxt 4 with Vue 3 and TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS custom properties for theming
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Better Auth with role-based access control
- **Mapping**: Leaflet for interactive map visualization
- **File Processing**: Custom GPX/TCX parsers with GeoJSON conversion
- **State Management**: Pinia for centralized state management
- **Real-time Sync**: Custom debounced synchronization system

### Architecture Principles

1. **Self-Hosted First**: Designed to run on user-controlled infrastructure
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works with JavaScript disabled for core functionality
3. **Mobile-Responsive**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences
4. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage throughout the application
5. **Performance**: Efficient data structures and lazy loading where appropriate

## User Interaction Flow

### 1. Authentication Flow

```
User Access → Login/Register → Session Creation → Role Assignment → Dashboard
```

- **Anonymous Users**: Redirected to login page
- **Authenticated Users**: Access based on role permissions
- **First User**: Automatically assigned "owner" role
- **Registration Control**: Can be disabled by administrators

### 2. Course Creation Workflow

```
File Upload → Validation → Processing → Metrics Calculation → Waypoint Extraction → Storage
```

1. **File Upload**: Users drag and drop or select GPX/TCX files
2. **Validation**: File format and content validation
3. **Processing**: Parse GPS data and convert to GeoJSON format
4. **Metrics Calculation**: Compute distance, elevation gain/loss, and route statistics
5. **Waypoint Extraction**: Automatically extract waypoints from file metadata
6. **Storage**: Save course data, original file content, and computed metrics

### 3. Course Interaction Workflow

```
Course Selection → Map Display → Interactive Exploration → Waypoint Management → Export/Share
```

1. **Course Selection**: Browse and select from user's course library
2. **Map Display**: Interactive map with route visualization and controls
3. **Interactive Exploration**: 
   - Hover over route for distance/elevation data
   - Click to create waypoints
   - Drag waypoints to reposition
4. **Waypoint Management**: Edit names, tags, and properties
5. **Export/Share**: Download original files or share course data

### 4. Settings and Customization Flow

```
Settings Access → Category Selection → Preference Updates → Real-time Sync → Visual Updates
```

1. **Settings Access**: Navigate to settings through user menu
2. **Category Selection**: Choose from General, Appearance, Cloud, or Admin settings
3. Preference Updates: Modify themes, unit strategy (follow course or override) and units, fonts, and system preferences
4. **Real-time Sync**: Changes synchronized across user sessions
5. **Visual Updates**: UI immediately reflects new preferences
